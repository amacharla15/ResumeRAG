EXPERIENCE
California State University, Chico - Web Developer (Nov 2025 - Present) - Chico, CA

CSU Chico: Owned and shipped the Chico Love event website end-to-end (landing pages, registration UX, backend integration).

CSU Chico: Implemented a registration backend on Cloudflare Workers + D1 with schema/index design, validation, and idempotent email uniqueness.

CSU Chico: Standardized a reproducible Wrangler workflow (local testing, schema apply, deploy, verification) to improve release reliability.

Cognizant Technology Solutions - Associate Software Engineer (Dec 2021 - Aug 2024) - Hyderabad, India

Cognizant: Built and maintained Java Spring Boot microservices for insurance claims and policy workflows for 10,000+ active users; improved API responsiveness via DB query optimization and payload tuning validated in Dynatrace.

Cognizant: Owned AWS production support and releases; monitored via Dynatrace, triaged and resolved 100+ incidents (auth, login, registration, integrations), and sustained 99.9% uptime.

Cognizant: Improved delivery quality with JUnit/Mockito tests and documentation, reducing onboarding time for new engineers.

Edureka - Data Science and Machine Learning Intern (Jan 2023 - Jul 2023) - Hyderabad, India

Edureka: Cleaned and prepared 1.3M rows (missing values, outliers, encodings) in a reproducible Pandas + SQL pipeline.

Edureka: Trained an Elastic Net logistic regression model with temporal validation; improved ROC-AUC and optimized the decision threshold to increase minority-class recall while tracking precision/recall tradeoffs.

PROJECTS
Hardware-Aware Training Time and Throughput Prediction (TensorFlow/Keras, NVIDIA A100, CIFAR-10) - Nov 2025

A100 CNN Predictor: Built a benchmark dataset across 143 CNN configs; logged sec/epoch, images/sec, params, accuracy with reproducible scripts + aggregation over repeats.

A100 CNN Predictor: Trained an ANN with linear baselines to predict sec/epoch using log-target modeling (R^2 = 0.994); derived throughput as 50,000 / predicted sec-per-epoch; validated on unseen configs (MAE = 0.10 sec/epoch, ~1.5k images/sec).

A100 CNN Predictor: Released a CLI-style predictor to estimate runtime and throughput for new CNN configs.

RAGOps Copilot (LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini API, Qdrant, FastAPI, Next.js) - Nov 2025 to Dec 2025

RAGOps Copilot: Built a developer RAG copilot over code/docs with auditable citations and traceable answers.

RAGOps Copilot: Implemented a LangGraph tool-calling workflow to draft and create GitHub issues via API; added request logging for p95 latency, token usage, and estimated cost.

Task Platform - Distributed Job Queue (FastAPI, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker) - Dec 2025

Task Platform: Built a Dockerized async task platform with idempotency-key deduplication, at-least-once processing, retries, and DLQ handling.

Task Platform: Load tested 2,000 tasks; measured worker throughput improvement from 31.25 tasks/sec (1 worker) to 41.7 tasks/sec (3 workers), a 33% gain; added Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.

University Marketplace (Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, GCP, Bootstrap) - Jan 2025 to May 2025

University Marketplace: Built a containerized backend with Django + PostgreSQL; deployed across multiple GCP VMs behind an HTTPS Load Balancer for high availability; used GCP Storage Buckets for secure image hosting; exposed a server_info endpoint for real-time environment/config visibility.
